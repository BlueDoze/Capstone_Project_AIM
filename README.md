# Fanshawe Navigator

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to create the **Fanshawe Navigator**, a web application designed to help students, staff, and visitors navigate the Fanshawe College campus. The application will provide an interactive map, search functionality for classrooms and services, and leverage the Gemini API to offer intelligent, conversational guidance.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main entry point for the Flask application.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering pages.
  - `index.html`: The main page of the application.
- `static/`: Contains static assets like CSS and JavaScript.
  - `style.css`: Basic styling for the application.
  - `script.js`: Basic JavaScript for the application.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies for the project.
- `devserver.sh`: A script used by the development environment to run the Flask server.
- `.env`: A file for storing environment variables and secrets. This file is not committed to version control.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

This project is configured to run in a specific development environment. Previews should run automatically when starting the workspace.

To run the server, open a terminal and use the `web` preview task, which executes the `./devserver.sh` script.

### Manual Setup After Cloning

If you clone this repository to a new machine, the `.venv` (virtual environment), `.env` (environment variables), and `__pycache__` directories will not be included. You will need to set them up manually.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your secret keys, such as your Gemini API key. For example:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_api_key'
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./devserver.sh
    ```

## Development Environment

- **Python Environment:** The environment uses Python 3 and a virtual environment located at `.venv`.
- **Dependency Management:** Project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Activation:** Before running any `python` or `pip` commands in the terminal, you must first activate the virtual environment:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Running the Server:** The Flask development server is started using the `web` preview task, which runs the `./devserver.sh` script.

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Secrets Management:** Never hard-code secrets like API keys. Use environment variables loaded from a `.env` file (e.g., using the `python-dotenv` library).
- **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent common vulnerabilities.

### Project Structure
- **Blueprints:** For larger applications, use Flask Blueprints to organize your code into smaller, reusable components.
- **Application Factory:** Use the application factory pattern to create application instances, which is useful for testing and managing different configurations.
