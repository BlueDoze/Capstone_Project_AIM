This document outlines the high-level features and requirements for the Fanshawe College Navigation Chatbot.

## User Stories

### Core Functionality: Chatbot & Navigation
- As a user, I want to interact with a chatbot to get directions to any room or location within Fanshawe College.
- As a user, I want to ask for directions in plain English (e.g., "How do I get to the library?" or "Where is room T1001?").
- As a user, I want the chatbot to provide clear, step-by-step walking directions as text in the chat interface.
- As a user, I want the chatbot's response to also include a visual representation of the route on an interactive map.
- As a user, I want the chatbot to be able to handle follow-up questions or clarify ambiguous locations.

### Interactive Map
- As a user, I want to be able to view and interact with a map of the entire Fanshawe College campus.
- As a user, I want to see my current location on the map to help me get oriented.
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a building or room on the map to get more information or start a navigation query.

### User Personalization
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account to save my class schedule or favorite locations (e.g., "my classroom", "the best coffee shop").
- As a user, I want to have a profile where I can easily access my saved locations for quick navigation.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my recent navigation history.

### Accessibility
- As a user with visual impairments, I want the chatbot and its text-based directions to be fully compatible with screen readers.
- As a user with motor impairments, I want to be able to navigate the application and interact with the chatbot using only my keyboard.

### Admin & System
- As an admin, I want a dashboard to manage the map data, including room numbers, building layouts, and points of interest.
- As an admin, I want to be able to review chatbot conversation logs to identify areas for improvement in its understanding and responses.
- As a developer, I want to use Flask Blueprints and an application factory to ensure the project is modular and scalable.
